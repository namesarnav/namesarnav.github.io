# Monte Carlo Options Pricer

A Monte Carlo engine for pricing European and American options — with variance
reduction, Greeks, and alternative asset dynamics — and a backtest that puts its
deltas to work hedging a real position on ten years of S&P 500 data.

The engine half is validated against independent deterministic references:
closed-form Black-Scholes, Merton's series solution, a binomial tree. The
backtest half has no oracle, which is the point of including it — it produces a
P&L that can be wrong in ways no reference value will catch.

98% test coverage on the pricing and simulation modules. Every figure and table
below is reproducible via `python scripts/generate_report.py`; Monte Carlo
results come from fixed seeds and market results from CSVs cached under `data/`.

## Results

### Delta-hedged straddle, S&P 500, 2016-2026

![hedging backtest](/projects/mcop/hedging_backtest.webp)

Each cycle sells a one-month at-the-money straddle on the index, hedges it with
the engine's delta, and holds to expiry. Spot, implied volatility (VIX) and the
discount rate (1-month T-bill) are real daily observations; 118 non-overlapping
cycles.

| scenario | ann. return | ann. vol | Sharpe | max drawdown |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| frictionless, daily hedge | +11.2% | 5.2% | 2.14 | −5.7% |
| IV −1.5 pts, 1bp cost, daily | +6.8% | 5.2% | 1.31 | −6.3% |
| IV −1.5 pts, 1bp cost, weekly | +7.6% | 7.3% | 1.04 | −14.3% |
| IV −3 pts, 1bp cost, daily | +2.8% | 5.2% | 0.54 | −10.6% |
| unhedged, IV −1.5 pts | +4.1% | 11.5% | 0.36 | −32.0% |

Three things the experiment actually shows:

**Hedging is what creates the Sharpe, not the premium.** Unhedged, the same
short-volatility position earns 0.36 and draws down 32%. The premium is
collected either way; delta hedging is what strips out the directional variance
around it.

**The edge is dominated by the volatility you sell at.** The VIX is a strip
across strikes and sits above the at-the-money implied volatility a straddle
actually trades at. Selling 1.5 volatility points below the VIX cuts the Sharpe
from 2.14 to 1.31; three points takes it to 0.54. Without real option chains I
cannot pin that number down, so it is reported as a sensitivity rather than
buried in a headline Sharpe.

**Rehedging daily beats weekly even after costs.** Weekly rehedging earns
slightly more gross but carries 40% more volatility and more than twice the
drawdown. At 1bp per rehedge the transaction costs are small next to the gamma
risk of leaving the position unhedged.

The mean entry implied volatility is 17.3% against 15.1% subsequently realised —
a 2.2 point variance risk premium, which is what the strategy harvests. The
worst cycle opened 19 February 2020 at an implied 12.9% and realised 84.3%.
Second worst was February 2018. Short volatility pays steadily and loses
violently, and the P&L path shows it.

**Limitations.** No historical option chains, so the straddle is constructed at
the VIX rather than at traded quotes: no bid-ask, no skew, no term structure
interpolation. Cycles are non-overlapping and start on a fixed calendar offset.
118 cycles is a small sample for a strategy whose risk is concentrated in tail
events, and two of them dominate the loss distribution.

### Convergence

Reference contract for the pricing results: $S_0 = K = 100$, $r = 5\%$,
$\sigma = 20\%$, $T = 1$. Black-Scholes call price **10.4506**.

![convergence](/projects/mcop/convergence.webp)

| paths | MC price | standard error |
|---|---|---|
| 1,000 | 9.8523 | 0.4552 |
| 10,000 | 10.5456 | 0.1470 |
| 100,000 | 10.5287 | 0.0468 |
| 1,000,000 | 10.4537 | 0.0147 |

The error falls by a factor of ten for every hundredfold increase in paths, the
signature of the $O(N^{-1/2})$ rate.

### Variance reduction (N = 500,000)

![variance reduction](/projects/mcop/variance_reduction.webp)

| estimator | price | standard error | variance removed | efficiency |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| naive | 10.4513 | 0.02082 | — | 1.00× |
| antithetic | 10.4409 | 0.01466 | 50.4% | 2.20× |
| control variate | 10.4466 | 0.00834 | 83.9% | 5.97× |

The control variate reaches in 500,000 paths an accuracy that naive sampling
would need roughly 3.1 million paths to match.

Variance removed is measured at a matched path count, which is not the same as
matched compute: antithetic draws half the normals per path, while the control
variate pays for a pilot run and a covariance estimate. The efficiency column is
the honest comparison — the ratio of $\text{variance} \times \text{runtime}$ against naive, so an
estimator only scores above 1.0 if it reaches a given error in less wall-clock
time. At this scale the two measures nearly agree, because random number
generation is not the bottleneck.

### Greeks (N = 2,000,000)

| Greek | method | Monte Carlo | closed form | error |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| delta | finite difference | 0.63715 ± 0.00041 | 0.63683 | 0.78 se |
| delta | pathwise | 0.63637 ± 0.00041 | 0.63683 | 1.13 se |
| vega | finite difference | 37.5612 ± 0.0536 | 37.5240 | 0.69 se |
| vega | pathwise | 37.4281 ± 0.0534 | 37.5240 | 1.80 se |
| gamma | finite difference | 0.018813 ± 0.000079 | 0.018762 | 0.67 se |

### American put

| method | price |
|---|---|
| Longstaff-Schwartz (500k paths, 50 steps) | 6.0846 ± 0.0101 |
| binomial tree (4,000 steps) | 6.0902 |
| European put (Black-Scholes) | 5.5735 |

Early exercise premium **0.5111**. The American call price matches the European
call to within one standard error, as it must without dividends.

### Volatility smiles

![smiles](/projects/mcop/volatility_smiles.webp)

| strike | 80 | 90 | 100 | 110 | 120 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| GBM | 0.1963 | 0.1981 | 0.1987 | 0.1989 | 0.1991 |
| Merton jumps | 0.2489 | 0.2426 | 0.2387 | 0.2365 | 0.2353 |
| Heston | 0.2447 | 0.2163 | 0.1887 | 0.1634 | 0.1448 |

GBM is flat by construction: one volatility goes in, the same one comes back
out at every strike. Merton's downward jumps fatten the left tail and lift
low-strike implied volatility. Heston's negative price-variance correlation
produces the steep skew seen in equity index markets.

## The maths

**Risk-neutral pricing.** Under no arbitrage there exists a measure under which
every discounted tradable price is a martingale. The option's price today is
therefore the discounted expectation of its payoff under that measure,
$C = e^{-rT}\,\mathbb{E}\!\left[\text{payoff}(S_T)\right]$, with the asset drifting at
$r$ rather than at its
real-world return. Monte Carlo estimates that expectation by sampling.

**Simulation.** Applying Itô's lemma to $\log S_t$ gives the exact solution

$$
S_T = S_0 \exp\!\left[\left(r - \tfrac{\sigma^2}{2}\right) T + \sigma \sqrt{T}\, Z\right],
\qquad Z \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1)
$$

Sampling in log space means no discretisation error and no possibility of a
negative price. For European payoffs no intermediate time steps are needed at
all; the full grid is only simulated for early exercise and stochastic
volatility.

**Convergence.** The estimator's standard error is
$e^{-rT}\sigma_{\text{payoff}} / \sqrt{N}$. Halving the error costs four times the paths;
one more decimal digit costs a hundred times. That cost curve is why variance
reduction matters more than brute force.

**Antithetic variates.** $S_T$ is monotone in $Z$, so the payoffs from $Z$ and
$-Z$ are negatively correlated and their average has lower variance than two
independent draws. The technique relies on that monotonicity, and would help
much less for a payoff that is not monotone in the underlying.

**Control variates.** For a control $Y$ with known mean, $X - c(Y - \mathbb{E}[Y])$ is
unbiased for any $c$, and its variance is minimised at
$c = \operatorname{Cov}(X, Y) / \operatorname{Var}(Y)$ —
the least-squares slope of $X$ on $Y$, which projects out the component of the
payoff that $Y$ explains. Here $Y = S_T$, whose mean $S_0 e^{rT}$ is known
exactly. The coefficient is fitted on a pilot sample and applied to a disjoint
main sample, so it is independent of the draws it corrects.

**Greeks.** Finite-difference estimators must price both legs of the bump on the
*same* normal draws. Otherwise the difference of two independently noisy prices
is divided by a small bump and the sampling noise is amplified by $1/h$; in this
project's tests, dropping common random numbers inflates delta's standard error
by a factor of roughly 1,800. The pathwise estimator differentiates the payoff
along each path instead,

$$
\frac{\partial C}{\partial S_0} = e^{-rT}\, \mathbb{E}\!\left[\mathbf{1}\{S_T > K\}\, \frac{S_T}{S_0}\right],
$$

which removes the bump entirely. Gamma has no pathwise estimator, since the first
derivative already contains an indicator function.

**American options.** Longstaff-Schwartz works backwards from maturity,
regressing realised discounted future cashflows on a polynomial in the current
spot to estimate the continuation value, and exercising where immediate value
exceeds it. Only in-the-money paths enter the regression. Because exercise is
restricted to the simulation grid and the exercise rule is estimated, LSM is a
lower bound that tightens as the grid is refined.

## Validation methodology

Two oracles contain no randomness and are tested against exact values first:
`black_scholes.py` (textbook prices, put-call parity, degenerate cases,
no-arbitrage bounds, Greeks cross-checked by finite-differencing the price
function) and `binomial.py` (convergence to Black-Scholes for European exercise).
Everything stochastic is then tested against them.

Statistical assertions are stated in standard errors computed from the sample
itself, never as hand-tuned tolerances — a Monte Carlo price must fall within
three standard errors of its closed-form reference. Coverage is checked
directly: across 100 seeds, the reported 95% confidence interval contains the
true price in 88-100 runs.

Simulators are additionally pinned by properties that must hold exactly:
$\sigma = 0$ collapses every path onto $S_0 e^{rT}$; $T = 0$ returns spot; the
discounted price is a martingale; the Itô drift correction is tested separately
from $\mathbb{E}[S_T]$, since a sign error there fails the two tests differently.
